Eventually, I'd like to automate setting up Firefox things, but here's a list for now.

# Plugins

* uBlock Origin
* 1Password
* Firefox Multi-Account Containers
* BetterTTV
* FrankerFaceZ
* Bypass Paywalls

# Other Settings

* Search -> Search Suggestions -> turn off "Show search suggestions ahead of browsing history in address bar results"
