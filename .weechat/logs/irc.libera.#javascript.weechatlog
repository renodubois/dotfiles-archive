2021-05-28 11:26:12	dom_jax	are people more pro-TS these days then?
2021-05-28 11:26:19	sheetjs	to an extent, once you start introducing compilers and transpilers, it doesn't really matter what you use
2021-05-28 11:26:33	Kirjava	although using stage-0 might bite you
2021-05-28 11:26:35	systemfault	dom_jax: IRL? Certainly. On this channel? NOPE.
2021-05-28 11:26:37	Kirjava	;_;
2021-05-28 11:26:46	sheetjs	practically speaking, modern JS is no different from a compile-to-JS language like typescript
2021-05-28 11:26:46	merpnderp	I hate TS.
2021-05-28 11:26:49	dom_jax	lol
2021-05-28 11:27:19	merpnderp	You might say "But isn't hate too strong of a word?" and I'd say "nope."
2021-05-28 11:27:42	merpnderp	Course I started TS in its very first days on angular 1.x
2021-05-28 11:27:45	merpnderp	So f TS.
2021-05-28 11:27:54	stenno	there is not much to hate about TS i think

2021-05-28 11:28:14	ljharb	stenno: yes there is
2021-05-28 11:28:23	merpnderp	If you want it to be more complicated to configure, implement, and maintain, then TS is for you.
2021-05-28 11:28:25	stenno	ljharb: there is much to hate about TS?
2021-05-28 11:28:39	Kirjava	stage <3 has all the fun stuff though

2021-05-28 11:29:21	Kirjava	less than three
2021-05-28 11:29:28	theskillwithin	oh lala
2021-05-28 11:30:05	dom_jax	it is an extra step when you take in to consideration compiling etc. but as sheetjs said, you have to do very similar things with modern JS anyway
2021-05-28 11:30:13	dom_jax	Well, a lot of us do
2021-05-28 11:30:15	sheetjs	n> var x = 0; x &= 1; x &&= 2; x

2021-05-28 11:30:28	Kirjava	I like the approach of just using LSP with typescript and having babel just strip everything out
2021-05-28 11:30:40	Kirjava	skipping tsc
2021-05-28 11:30:55	systemfault	Kirjava: I do mostly TS on the backend... so tsc alone is enough
2021-05-28 11:31:07	ljharb	tsc should only ever be used for typechecking
2021-05-28 11:31:12	ljharb	it's a shitty transpiler
2021-05-28 11:31:18	systemfault	Says the guy who hates the language.
2021-05-28 11:31:39	dom_jax	and then babel for the other bits ljharb?
2021-05-28 11:31:42	ljharb	i'm not sure why my opinion of TS has any bearing on my opinion of the quality of its output
2021-05-28 11:31:43	ljharb	dom_jax: yes
2021-05-28 11:31:53	theskillwithin	i don't like TS as well, a lot of setup for not much benefit on frontend
2021-05-28 11:31:55	ljharb	TS is "fine" but it's got lots of bugs and is not a superset of JS
2021-05-28 11:32:27	joepie91	my main complaint about TS is that it makes the nice features of JS harder to use
2021-05-28 11:32:46	joepie91	in exchange for questionable reliability improvements
2021-05-28 11:33:02	joepie91	(which may actually be negative depending on circumstances)
2021-05-28 11:33:17	Kirjava	it's heavily use case dependent imo
2021-05-28 11:33:32	joepie91	as a type system it's just not a very good one
2021-05-28 11:33:39	systemfault	joepie91: Because you say so?
2021-05-28 11:33:43	merpnderp	For SPA's at $work, I never encounter a bug and think "Man, strong typing would have kept this from happening."

2021-05-28 11:34:05	Kirjava	in contrast I use JS nearly always and get that thought a lot
2021-05-28 11:34:05	ljharb	those kinds of bugs just don't happen in reality

2021-05-28 11:34:24	joepie91	merpnderp: that matches my experience. my code certainly has bugs, but almost never of the type (heh) that TS would have prevented
2021-05-28 11:34:27	ljharb	google did a study on the entire internet, for their "strong mode" proposal, and found that avoiding type coercions wouldn't actually help enough to make the proposal worth it

2021-05-28 11:34:33	merpnderp	joepie91: lol
2021-05-28 11:34:35	ljharb	because *people don't ship those kinds of bugs*
2021-05-28 11:34:55	theskillwithin	ill say this, iv never ever on frontend been confused about what type something is
2021-05-28 11:35:08	systemfault	theskillwithin: Unrelated.
2021-05-28 11:35:31	theskillwithin	so therefor i don't use ts
2021-05-28 11:35:33	merpnderp	Is it a string, is it an object, is it superman? If you find yourself asking these questions, your code is spaghetti and you need to start over.
2021-05-28 11:35:43	systemfault	theskillwithin: Let's say you have function "lol" that takes a string as a parameter, but it can only be "omg" or "rofl", then with TS you can enforce that
2021-05-28 11:35:51	joepie91	the benefits are more pronounced with a Rust-style type system that also encodes ownership, but that itself then comes at a significant cost that isn't always (or maybe even 'often') worth it
2021-05-28 11:36:01	systemfault	theskillwithin: You'll see a red line if you use any other string... it's no big deal really
2021-05-28 11:36:08	ljharb	you can't actually enforce it
2021-05-28 11:36:11	systemfault	I can personally live with JS or with TS
2021-05-28 11:36:15	ljharb	you can only enforce it in typed code
2021-05-28 11:36:21	ljharb	runtime type checks let you actually enforce it
2021-05-28 11:36:41	joepie91	if your function is called 'lol' and your inputs are 'omg' and 'rofl', you probably have bigger problems than type annotations
2021-05-28 11:36:51	ljharb	roflcopter()
2021-05-28 11:36:58	systemfault	joepie91: Thanks for missing the point.
2021-05-28 11:37:02	theskillwithin	tis an example
2021-05-28 11:37:15	joepie91	yes, it's an example that is so contrived that it no longer resembles reality
2021-05-28 11:37:27	stenno	soi soi soi
2021-05-28 11:37:29	systemfault	fetch(myUrl, { includes: '?????' }) ?
2021-05-28 11:37:30	joepie91	it's intentionally chosen to be poorly named and designed
2021-05-28 11:37:41	systemfault	Is that real-world enough for you?
2021-05-28 11:37:44	ljharb	the in-editor prompts are nice.; but you don't need TS for that.
2021-05-28 11:37:56	dom_jax	JSDoc
2021-05-28 11:38:04	merpnderp	systemfault: but I wouldn't pass a string. I'd create an object to emulate and enums? const lolParams = {omg: true, rofl: true};
2021-05-28 11:38:16	cog	TS rarely saves me from initial development bugs.  But it has saved me from so many refactor bugs it's insane.
2021-05-28 11:38:40	merpnderp	systemfault: now my code complete means if I fat finger it, I'll know instantly, but I won't because I'll see the code complete option and click *tab* and never have a problem.
2021-05-28 11:38:41	GreenJello	I'm writing a lambda currently with JS+jsdoc+tsc
2021-05-28 11:38:42	systemfault	(For the fetch example, the name of the property is 'credentials', not 'includes')
2021-05-28 11:38:44	theskillwithin	systemfault only time id appreciate ts is if u backends don't give me consistent data 😛
2021-05-28 11:38:58	systemfault	GreenJello: How is it working so far?
2021-05-28 11:39:05	GreenJello	surprisingly not terrible
2021-05-28 11:39:16	cog	theskillwithin: That happens more often than I'd like with APIs.
2021-05-28 11:39:20	ljharb	jsdoc, eesh
2021-05-28 11:39:22	ljharb	i'd rather use TS
2021-05-28 11:39:33	ljharb	cog: tests should save you from those
2021-05-28 11:40:39	systemfault	Anyway, good luck trying to avoid learning a little TS. Unless you're a freelance, you _will_ eventually have to deal with it.
2021-05-28 11:40:54	systemfault	Every new big project is typed...
2021-05-28 11:41:05	systemfault	Every frontend framework is typed.

2021-05-28 11:42:00	systemfault	Which one?
2021-05-28 11:42:00	ljharb	react doesn't use TS.
2021-05-28 11:42:06	systemfault	It uses FlowType.
2021-05-28 11:42:08	systemfault	So?
2021-05-28 11:42:21	ljharb	"is typed" doesn't mean "you have to learn TS"
2021-05-28 11:42:23	systemfault	I said "typed", not "using TS"
2021-05-28 11:42:24	ljharb	those are different.
2021-05-28 11:42:25	theskillwithin	idk what react uses, i just use react
2021-05-28 11:42:37	ljharb	many big projects are typed. not every one is.
2021-05-28 11:42:47	ljharb	not every typed project uses TS, altho ofc all new ones do
2021-05-28 11:43:10	ljharb	and that you should know how to use TS, doesn't mean it's a good choice for every project.
2021-05-28 11:43:43	systemfault	I personally love TS's type system, and I thank JS for it. But I really hate all those C#ers/Javaers trying to import their silly patterns in TS/JS

2021-05-28 11:44:32	shan	are there any cool articles from around the time JS first came out

2021-05-28 11:48:55	systemfault	I don't remember if you can strip them using your bundler though...
2021-05-28 11:48:58	ljharb	and as such, it's much more powerful than what flow or TS can do

2021-05-28 11:49:00	ljharb	you can strip them

2021-05-28 11:56:58	wovixo	Svelte seems to be running a pretty big hype machine, but less code and a smaller footprint in the browser is mighty appealing, especially if the performance numbers are actually true.

2021-05-28 12:01:33	theskillwithin	iv seen too many projects excited about stuff like that, and then refactor to react once it gets larger

2021-05-28 12:02:08	shan	honestly there's no way to really describe svelte other than "really refreshing and cool"
2021-05-28 12:02:12	wovixo	theskillwithin: Projects that started with Svelte, or similar tools?
2021-05-28 12:02:28	shan	try building something simple or following along with the tutorial, they've put a lot of effort into making it easy to learn and use
2021-05-28 12:03:14	dom_jax	may be a noob question, but how does debugging work on the frontend with Svelte?

2021-05-28 12:04:13	shan	https://svelte.dev/tutorial/debug nice
2021-05-28 12:04:32	shan	One approach is to use console.log(...) inside your markup. If you want to pause execution, though, you can use the {@debug ...} tag with a comma-separated list of values you want to inspect:  If you now open your devtools and start interacting with the <input> elements, you'll trigger the debugger as the value of user changes.

2021-05-28 12:06:17	wovixo	Yeah, pretty swank. It actually works pretty well, at least their little demo does. How that scales to larger apps is another question.
2021-05-28 12:06:29	shan	good question
2021-05-28 12:07:21	wovixo	It's not clear to me if the source files are 'compiled' to one file or several.
