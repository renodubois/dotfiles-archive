2021-05-27 16:43:21	iDrougge	SF?
2021-05-27 16:43:29	sth	i mean, oracle and ibm aren't on there
2021-05-27 16:43:48	@Irenes	also, "FAANG" isn't just the "abusive megacorps" list, it's also the list that investors care about
2021-05-27 16:43:48	edk	i think it sort of makes sense. even when microsoft were at the top everyone knew they were evil
2021-05-27 16:43:49	sth	both have done at least as much EEE as MS
2021-05-27 16:43:58	ngoldbaum	also i think microsoft didn’t buy in quite as much with the crazy compensation arms race
2021-05-27 16:44:02	ngoldbaum	and also yeah sf bay
2021-05-27 16:44:04	@Irenes	so it's mostly companies that have maintained a sense of *newness*
2021-05-27 16:44:08	ngoldbaum	ms is all up in seattle
2021-05-27 16:44:17	@Irenes	not actual newness, mind. Apple and Microsoft are about the same age.
2021-05-27 16:44:24	@Irenes	just the public perception of it.
2021-05-27 16:44:29	sth	riiight
2021-05-27 16:44:33	ngoldbaum	technomancy: so i guess the explanation is los gatos
2021-05-27 16:44:37	goodger	oracle and IBM are both tiny compared to microsoft...
2021-05-27 16:45:16	goodger	at least according to its definitely-sustainable market cap
2021-05-27 16:45:28	ngoldbaum	also: the netflix test movies of a guy running around netflix’s old hq are delightful
2021-05-27 16:45:39	alb	navidr: do you have someone you can ask? I think if they're already interested in you doing an internship, and are a student, then it's probably going to work out. But you'll need to ask the specific company
2021-05-27 16:46:04	alb	I thought the FAANG thing was/started as a financial term, that's why those 5 were included or something like that?
2021-05-27 16:46:05	brennen	i think netflix-as-abusive-tech-megacorp could draw some energy from "has basically eaten the film industry"
2021-05-27 16:46:30	navidr	alb: I can ask my recruiter or team manager. But I am hesitant to be honest yet. (Microsoft)
2021-05-27 16:46:36	@c355e3b	HA HA, Someone else up-voted JSONLogic
2021-05-27 16:46:42	brennen	i mean, public perception of them probably isn't Evil Monopoly yet, but it's only a question of time.
2021-05-27 16:47:05	@c355e3b	navidr: IMO, bring it up halfway through the internship
2021-05-27 16:47:18	iDrougge	It's funny. Two generations ago, film and record companies were owned by oil companies, one generation ago, they were owned by home electronics companies. Now, they're owned by "tech" companies.
2021-05-27 16:47:19	@c355e3b	Either they like you and will get HR to give your a junior offer, or you know you need to start looking
2021-05-27 16:47:47	alb	yeah, if you didn't lie then it's probably going to be fine, I doubt anyone cares too much (but I've no idea how these things are at Microsoft)
2021-05-27 16:48:20	iDrougge	navidr: Do you even want to work there?

2021-05-27 16:49:38	@Irenes	but hype still works pretty effectively as a marketing strategy for tech stuff
2021-05-27 16:49:43	@Irenes	so it's not over quite yet
2021-05-27 16:49:57	navidr	alb: yes. I didn’t. I do have it on my transcript too. This semester I changed the program, and I am eligible to graduate

2021-05-27 16:50:18	pe	When was the last time computers seemed new and exciting to you?
2021-05-27 16:50:26	pe	I get disappointed by almost any piece of tech I meet.
2021-05-27 16:50:31	pe	And it's getting worse.
2021-05-27 16:50:51	pe	Wherever a "computer" is involved.
2021-05-27 16:50:58	@Irenes	excitement isn't why I personally do this stuff. it was when I was young, but at this point it's more like there is stuff that I see that needs to be done for the good of society, and it largely involves computers.
2021-05-27 16:50:59	iDrougge	I think it was much worse ten years ago. Java and XML.

2021-05-28 11:35:41	geoffwozniak	I don't know the deeper reason, but what I do know is they want the variables to appear in read-only memory but want the ability to have them change by something other than the program
2021-05-28 11:36:31	geoffwozniak	So on the device it sits in flash memory and... something else is changing flash
2021-05-28 11:36:46	letoram	ran into that in some embedded for C++ training at CPPcon - modelling read-only memory mapped i/o registers being one case
2021-05-28 11:36:55	geoffwozniak	note: writing to flash is non-trivial, so I don't know what is doing it
2021-05-28 11:37:38	geoffwozniak	Usually weird registers like that appear in the memory map for the device, but these ones are in the program space

2021-05-28 11:40:30	geoffwozniak	We've had discussions for adding builtins to facilitate writing to flash and it would be a massive job because it's device specific and the hardware people don't want to help

2021-05-28 14:42:24	companion_cube	wow ok, seems like Bad shouldn't even be accepted
2021-05-28 14:42:28	rwb	'static doesn't mean absence of a lifetime, it means the boundary between creation and destruction disappears, and you're in a state neither existent or nonexistent.  Just as if you were alive and dead in memory at the same time, a Necrofantasia.
2021-05-28 14:42:35	companion_cube	you shan't return a `&'static Box`…

2021-05-28 14:48:14	companion_cube	crazy
2021-05-28 14:48:31	rwb	then you're allowed to drop the original box which doesn't trigger borrowck. now you can create a new box in its place which points to nullptr, and deref it

2021-05-28 14:49:48	rwb	note that s really points to _x by the time the println is reached

2021-05-28 14:50:42	rwb	the commit fixing it should thank /g/
2021-05-28 14:50:46	companion_cube	but of course it's (), so that's magic
2021-05-28 14:51:00	rwb	() is bottom type right
2021-05-28 14:51:07	companion_cube	unit type
2021-05-28 14:51:13	rwb	hm
2021-05-28 14:51:31	companion_cube	so it's 0 sized, it contains exactly one value so you don't need to remember any information to know which one
2021-05-28 14:51:38	rwb	exactly
2021-05-28 14:51:44	rwb	so i think borrowck is more lenient with unit, cause not like you can do anything with it
2021-05-28 14:51:45	companion_cube	so like `Vec<()>` is a fun alias for `usize`
2021-05-28 14:51:56	rwb	but if you tie its lifetime to something else, you can cause trouble :^)
2021-05-28 14:52:00	companion_cube	it's more lenient with some zero sized types I think, yeah

2021-05-28 21:54:20	pushcx	lkhrs: Freenode we had ~550.
2021-05-28 21:54:39	pe	I specifically remember it above 600 when I posted EICAR.
2021-05-28 21:54:42	kline	we're not up to scratch with what freenode had a month ago, but we're close, and meanwhile the new freenode staff dont know how to use the tools we left behind
2021-05-28 21:54:51	lkhrs	Ah makes sense, I read pushcx's message as the average was 250 on freenode
2021-05-28 21:55:51	kline	when we first split, there was a pretty major wave of spam, as comes on the back of any irc drama, and the new freenode administrations response was to global message everyone begging them to turn on their personal spam filters
2021-05-28 21:56:27	kline	the network we left has more powerful and centrally managed tools that could have been used, i can only imagine they dont know how to use them yet
2021-05-28 21:56:55	Ori_B	lkhrs: it required email validation to even join channels for me, which is more than freenode needed.
2021-05-28 21:57:11	hoistbypetard	understanding that this is not an attempt to name names/dox/etc... who are new freenode staff? just friends of Lee? Rizon staff? rando folks from *chan?
2021-05-28 21:57:53	fro	isn't there a list of staff on their website you can look at?
2021-05-28 21:57:59	pe	I like how you have little compartments of hatred in your head.
2021-05-28 21:58:07	pushcx	fro: The list is only handles, no background or links.
2021-05-28 21:58:15	fro	i mean
2021-05-28 21:58:19	fro	do you need more than that?
2021-05-28 21:58:26	hoistbypetard	it's not compartments of hatred, pe...
2021-05-28 21:58:38	hoistbypetard	just curiosity about what background they're pulling from
2021-05-28 21:58:50	pushcx	pe: Where did hoistbypetard say any of those categories were hated?
2021-05-28 21:59:21	pe	Could say it more precisely. E.g. evil.
2021-05-28 21:59:37	pe	Though as a heuristic it may not be bad.
2021-05-28 21:59:44	hoistbypetard	those were examples of what i thought might be probable, not categories of people i love/hate/think are good/evil...
2021-05-28 22:00:17	pe	If it's random folks, certainly from 4chan!
2021-05-28 22:01:29	pe	I've seen unaffiliated people launch DDoS attacks often enough.
2021-05-28 22:01:38	pe	For fun.

2021-05-28 22:03:29	pe	Well, they brag about it.

2021-05-28 22:25:02	hoistbypetard	i don't mind choosing to pay the freight for images and videos and voip and similar when i want to use those features. but, for example, if i click on a discord link by accident, my fans spin up and 45 seconds later the window starts to render in my browser, for a sufficiently large server.

2021-06-02 15:39:52	bird	extremely thinking out loud energy here: your goal is an algorithm that doesn't invalidate cache. which means that you have to ray cast for the full length of "visibility", in some cases it might actually be "cheaper" to do two ray casts, one that's terminating when it hits a "solid" tile and stores the ray delta and then a second pass that does
2021-06-02 15:39:52	bird	the tile list for that given distance
2021-06-02 15:40:33	bird	i mean you're going to evict cache on multiple passes but also if this is truly 2d who gives a goddamn fuck lmao that shit will run fast on anything

2021-06-02 15:42:57	bird	2: on second pass cast only the distance per unit and make a tile list
2021-06-02 15:42:57	bird	3: gather the tile lists and calculate if that ray should “hit” or not

2021-06-02 16:36:40	drakonis	danderson`: i'm 14 hours late to the discussion but i definitely wouldn't refer to guix as the drunk old man yelling about foss to passerbys, i'd use that description for other gnu distros
2021-06-02 16:36:53	drakonis	https://git.hyperbola.info:50100/software/blacklist.git/log/ look at this amazing amazing thing
2021-06-02 16:37:07	drakonis	and its slightly less insane variant https://git.parabola.nu/abslibre/blacklist.git/
2021-06-02 16:41:13	iDrougge	I would just shrug if there were sensible non-nonfree alternatives.
2021-06-02 16:41:20	terinjokes	I would want to use guix (so I can use guile), but the community being so actively negative towards anything that isn't FOSS was a big turnoff.
2021-06-02 16:42:57	drakonis	idk
2021-06-02 16:43:07	drakonis	they've mellowed out a fair bit

2021-06-02 16:43:36	steenuil	but why
2021-06-02 16:43:39	drakonis	it exists purely on a "just dont talk about it in the public official guix channels"
2021-06-02 16:43:45	drakonis	because gnu distro etc etc
2021-06-02 16:44:02	drakonis	there is #nonguix if you want to talk about this
2021-06-02 16:44:13	drakonis	there's a fairly reasonable amount of users
2021-06-02 16:44:46	technomancy	"don't recommend this in official docs" is reasonable-ish; "don't mention this exists in any public channel" is super sketch
2021-06-02 16:44:57	iDrougge	The ones that actually want Guix to survive.
2021-06-02 16:45:00	technomancy	the former is roughly the Debian approach afaict
2021-06-02 16:45:46	drakonis	it does come up, sure.
2021-06-02 16:45:59	demize	I can see why they'd do that so that the Guix project doesn't try to act against them in any way.
2021-06-02 16:46:03	drakonis	but the actual stance is to not recommend nonfree software
2021-06-02 16:46:07	technomancy	you just need a wink and a sly nod if you want to do morally-questionable things like *checks clipboard* connect to a wifi access point

2021-06-02 16:47:20	technomancy	cb: my understanding is that in theory refusing to acknowledge the non-free wifi drivers would lead to people developing free alternatives
2021-06-02 16:47:29	technomancy	which completely hasn't happened at all?

2021-06-02 16:48:42	cb	yeah exactly
2021-06-02 16:48:51	cb	but the FSF requested they remove the HW entirely
2021-06-02 16:48:52	technomancy	but yeah, point stands even if they hadn't
2021-06-02 16:48:55	cb	make it a no-op, because of the blob
2021-06-02 16:49:10	drakonis	i dont know if this has anything to do with me knowing how to navigate the guix community's norms, but they were kinda reasonable

2021-06-02 16:49:23	cb	technomancy: yuppppp
2021-06-02 16:49:25	cb	that said: i respect guix bc it's one of the few gnu projects nowadays pushing boundaries

2021-06-02 16:49:41	 *	cb bought a precursor, so they respect bunnie
2021-06-02 16:49:52	terinjokes	my corporate laptop doesn't work without binary blobs and updated firmware. trying to navigate that without having communication channels to discuss problems in, and being shuned from official channels, makes it a no-go, no matter how much i care about free software in userland.
2021-06-02 16:50:09	drakonis	they dont really shun you my guy

2021-06-02 16:52:06	drakonis	i think the whole situation is a bit overstated
2021-06-02 16:52:45	danderson`	my impression is based entirely on how people in #guix have acted in reality, not my impression of guix as a gnu-affiliated project

2021-06-02 16:53:20	terinjokes	my experience is based on trying to put the pieces together to get my laptop working, not based on what other gnu-affiliated projects do

2021-06-03 10:06:27	manicennui	I don't.

2021-06-03 10:07:09	ignaloidas	games(especially shooters) which have good audio are a lot more fun to play in general than those that don't
2021-06-03 10:07:23	ngoldbaum	games are already realistic enough graphics wise, it’s all the other aspects limited by controller or mouse/keyboard input where things need to be more realistic
2021-06-03 10:07:23	manicennui	Good doesn't really mean realistic.

2021-06-03 10:19:29	ngoldbaum	another axis that hasn’t really been explored in games is narrative realism and believable characters and stories, e.g. didco elysium
2021-06-03 10:19:56	ngoldbaum	which admittedly has sci-fi/fantasy aspects but also has really top notch, even unparalleled characterization in a game

2021-06-03 10:48:53	cb	my favourite game of all time is still deus ex for reasons despite its flaws
2021-06-03 10:49:01	technomancy	it actually reminds me a lot of deus ex

2021-06-03 14:22:20	manicennui	Not sure what Scala calls them, but pretty sure it has them.
2021-06-03 14:23:00	daegalus	I am down for all of that. I love using go, but it does hamper me when I need to do something that needs this stuff and i have to write it in a convoluted way or way more verbose than it needs to. But im not the biggest fan of Rust, at least every time i try to get into it, i just want some of the features in Go.
2021-06-03 14:23:21	ario_	I've been wanting a reason to try Go :P
2021-06-03 14:23:54	manicennui	I just find that Go code tends to be like 75% boilerplate for dealing with error handling and data structure manipulation, and the actual problem I'm trying to solve gets lost.
2021-06-03 14:24:10	daegalus	i think i just cant wrap my head or dont like the whole borrow/ownership system. I know why it works and why it is popular, but it just doesnt play nice with my brain
2021-06-03 14:24:11	oo	I'd love error unwrapping like ? and ! in rust
2021-06-03 14:24:18	manicennui	daegalus: Yeah, there are many of us who basically want something that is more like Rust with a GC.
2021-06-03 14:24:48	companion_cube	Church: the BS people are doing "rescript" which is not OCaml compatible anymore, and drops some features
2021-06-03 14:24:51	manicennui	I'd even deal with not having something quite as nice as Cargo.
2021-06-03 14:24:56	companion_cube	so that's a not
2021-06-03 14:24:58	companion_cube	no*
2021-06-03 14:25:12	companion_cube	people instead are going towards https://github.com/melange-re/melange/ I think
2021-06-03 14:25:36	daegalus	I also just like how streamlined and performant the compiler is. and how easy it is to cross-compile with Go.
2021-06-03 14:25:53	manicennui	I hope that all of these things that produce JS switch to producing WASM eventually, and we have many great options for running WASM.
2021-06-03 14:25:57	daegalus	creating windows/linux/macos binaries is a breeze
2021-06-03 14:26:16	manicennui	daegalus: Not super hard with Rust afaik.
2021-06-03 14:26:38	kline	companion_cube, melange like spice?
2021-06-03 14:26:52	manicennui	Although I always find weird quirks in Rust.
2021-06-03 14:27:08	manicennui	I learned the other night that one must use nightly to compile certain crates, and it has been this way for years.

2021-06-03 14:27:31	manicennui	Specifically a crate that is used by many game libraries to use SIMD instructions.
2021-06-03 14:27:41	sam_	yep..
2021-06-03 14:28:07	manicennui	Anything other than x86 must use nightly to build it...
2021-06-03 14:28:38	manicennui	Maybe that will change if more ARM architectures become common.
2021-06-03 14:28:54	manicennui	But I assume some people want to use Rust for native mobile development too.
2021-06-03 14:28:59	manicennui	I don't fully understand the issue though.
2021-06-03 14:29:07	manicennui	Just seems weird.

2021-06-03 14:29:47	Remosi	While we are talking about rust quirks, the generated binary sizes are super massive too.
2021-06-03 14:29:59	manicennui	Remosi: Did you do a release build?
2021-06-03 14:29:59	pe	As in Go.
2021-06-03 14:30:06	Remosi	manicennui, yes.
2021-06-03 14:30:16	Remosi	manicennui, and tweaked a few things too
2021-06-03 14:30:18	manicennui	I haven't really paid attention to the binary sizes.
2021-06-03 14:30:29	companion_cube	kline: that's a bit of the joke yes
2021-06-03 14:31:01	companion_cube	OCaml -> camel -> desert, so now we have dune, melange, …
2021-06-03 14:31:03	companion_cube	used to have oasis
2021-06-03 14:31:18	daegalus	manicennui: yes and no, Rust relies on LLVM, so its the same as setting up LLVM to compile to other platforms. You need the right support tools and abis install. Go just compiles it directly without any of the support tools just by setting a couple env vars.
2021-06-03 14:31:22	kline	i like it
2021-06-03 14:31:45	manicennui	daegalus: I see.
2021-06-03 14:33:04	daegalus	Honestly, with modern computers, i dont end up caring about binary size. HD space is cheap. If i was developing for a small board or restrictive environment, sure. but desktop computing? I stopped caring
2021-06-03 14:33:27	daegalus	but I am also one of those people that doesn't get butthurt about electron apps
2021-06-03 14:33:42	daegalus	i wouldnt mind alternatives, but thats purely so i dont have to write JS, not because im anti-electron
2021-06-03 14:34:47	pe	Large binaries also take long to copy.
2021-06-03 14:35:17	companion_cube	I mean there's a difference between a 15MB binary, and an electron app
2021-06-03 14:35:34	daegalus	agreed
2021-06-03 14:35:41	manicennui	How much of the difference is due to static versus dynamic linking?
2021-06-03 14:35:56	daegalus	probably most of it.
2021-06-03 14:35:59	pe	Our C++ build at work is about 1G of binaries and it breaks GitLab CI.

2021-06-03 14:36:05	sam_	lol
2021-06-03 14:36:20	Brekkjern	For a desktop computer I personally don't give a flying fuck as long as the binary is smaller than 100MB for most tools or apps.
2021-06-03 14:36:32	@c355e3b	anyone know of a reference for what struct pt_regs looks like?
2021-06-03 14:36:38	Brekkjern	Smaller than 500MB if it's a somewhat complex tool
2021-06-03 14:36:53	manicennui	Less than half my hard drive for a game.
2021-06-03 14:36:58	daegalus	ah, gitlab ci. We are dropping Gitlab so hard at our company. We moved to Github + Cloudbees (jenkins). And while I hate jenkisn with a firey passion, boy does it work better than Gitlab CI
2021-06-03 14:37:52	daegalus	(disclaimer, im on the team deploying/mananging/etc the Cloudbees deployment and all related jenkins controllers) so i have extra firey hate for it
2021-06-03 14:38:01	manicennui	We use both Jenkins and Circle CI.
2021-06-03 14:38:11	manicennui	We run tests with Circle CI, but use Jenkins for the actual deploy.
2021-06-03 14:38:15	daegalus	At least its all in kubernetes, with pods, and pod workers
2021-06-03 14:38:27	manicennui	Not clear to me whether we could be using one tool for both.
2021-06-03 14:38:43	daegalus	you could use either for both. Jenkins definitely can do both
2021-06-03 14:39:01	daegalus	honestly jenkins/hudson has been doing both for decades
2021-06-03 14:39:09	manicennui	I have no idea what the thinking is, and its not a battle I want to fight.
2021-06-03 14:39:13	companion_cube	like, Tracy is 13MB
2021-06-03 14:39:18	companion_cube	it's C++, and I think that's reasonable
2021-06-03 14:39:53	manicennui	ripgrep is about 5.9MB, and grep is about 34K.
2021-06-03 14:40:11	manicennui	No idea what all grep depends on.
2021-06-03 14:40:50	companion_cube	glibc?
2021-06-03 14:41:01	companion_cube	34k seems weirdly small though
2021-06-03 14:41:16	Remosi	daegalus, yeah, for desktop apps who cares? :)

2021-06-03 14:42:19	daegalus	on linux to be specific (WSL linux, but that doesnt matter to the go output binary)
2021-06-03 14:43:21	geoffwozniak	grep is 195K on my Ubuntu install and it relies on libc, libpcre, and other system libs that basically everything uses
2021-06-03 14:43:34	manicennui	ripgrep does use some shared libraries too though:

2021-06-03 14:46:23	Remosi	libre2 is 460K
2021-06-03 14:46:37	daegalus	i believe at minimum there will always be a dynamic link to the system stuff.
2021-06-03 14:46:43	manicennui	Weird: https://crates.io/crates/grep
2021-06-03 14:46:51	doug	there's ldd output? but wait, i thought go was statically linked!
2021-06-03 14:46:52	manicennui	"This crate provides a pcre2 feature (disabled by default) which, when enabled, re-exports the grep-pcre2 crate as an alternative Matcher implementation to the standard grep-regex implementation."
2021-06-03 14:46:54	daegalus	unless you compile it to be fully static and bootab
2021-06-03 14:46:58	daegalus	bootable

2021-06-03 14:47:22	daegalus	by default no, you can pass in flags to static link. just running `go build` with nothing else is dynamic
2021-06-03 14:47:49	doug	bootable?
2021-06-03 14:48:00	manicennui	I wonder how much of the ripgrep binary is serde.

2021-06-03 14:50:45	manicennui	I don't mind binaries being larger, and I get that static linking has many advantages, but it would be nice not to go through another cycle where we negate all gains in computer hardware by making everything worse.

2021-06-03 15:04:00	manicennui	Of course OpenBSD releases had cooler artwork, and a song!
2021-06-03 15:05:49	manicennui	Arch gives me a lot of what I liked about FreeBSD.
2021-06-03 15:06:00	manicennui	The AUR is very similar to ports.
2021-06-03 15:06:20	manicennui	The Arch wiki is at least as good as the FreeBSD handbook.

2021-06-03 15:15:19	hoistbypetard	that'd do it
2021-06-03 15:15:38	niflce	rust ate as 90% of  memory as it could be to build huge thing
2021-06-03 15:16:39	niflce	it ends up with make error no exception for my laptop
2021-06-03 15:17:17	pe	C++ and Rust are in a similar category of building awfulness.
2021-06-03 15:18:36	pe	Though sometimes I'm surprised even by how GCC and Clang are inexplicably slow.
2021-06-03 15:19:04	niflce	rust might be good for performance in cases
2021-06-03 15:19:37	niflce	indeed
2021-06-03 15:20:24	manicennui	Imagine transporting developers from today back to the punchcard era, where you might have to wait until the next day to get the output from your program.
2021-06-03 15:20:47	daegalus	doing Linux From Scratch as a teenager really gave me a wonderful foundation to just know how linux works and be able to reason about the system when i work in it or have to fix something
2021-06-03 15:21:16	manicennui	daegalus: I did a lot with FreeBSD in my early 20s. I think it is comparable to gentoo.
2021-06-03 15:21:30	manicennui	You can rebuild the entire system including userland and the kernel.
2021-06-03 15:21:51	manicennui	Also configured all kinds of things by hand.
2021-06-03 15:22:06	manicennui	I'm just too lazy to be bothered with all of that most of the time now.
2021-06-03 15:22:14	daegalus	I never ended up doing gentoo. I went from learning Redhat from my mom, to Mandrake Linux, to Slackware, to LFS, then Ubuntu, Arch, back to ubuntu, and nowadays I run Manjaro for desktop and Ubuntu for servers.
2021-06-03 15:22:26	niflce	LFS as i thnk personally given full control and kiss

2021-06-03 15:22:48	manicennui	Unfortunately I'm trying to figure out how the various pieces of X work now and how to configure them.
2021-06-03 15:23:31	manicennui	I have this crazy idea that I'm going to write a window manager for fun.
2021-06-03 15:23:35	niflce	actually x is simple which doesnt take time alot
2021-06-03 15:23:47	manicennui	niflce: I don't find it at all simple.
2021-06-03 15:24:10	daegalus	most of the time, I still use Windows as my primary OS. ive tried multiple times to make Linux my main OS, as recently as doing Manjaro all of last year for personal and work stuff. Went back to Windows with WSL this year because Linux Desktop is still a shitshow. I love linux, but god do the Desktop environments end up sucking. even mature ones like KDE. dont get me started on Gnome, it just

2021-06-03 15:24:16	niflce	for basic work
2021-06-03 15:24:18	manicennui	Mostly because I don't have a good mental model of how the various pieces fit together.
2021-06-03 15:24:26	daegalus	im generally anti-gtk nowadays,
2021-06-03 15:25:04	niflce	so do I , I just use emacs as window manager
2021-06-03 15:25:04	manicennui	I mean, that's fine until you want to run one of the thousands of gtk programs out there.
2021-06-03 15:25:49	daegalus	oh, when i say `anti-gtk` its not that i wont use it, but if I find a QT alternative i like, or ever have to build Linux desktop apps (aka never) i avoid gtk, but i use plenty of gtk stuff because thats what is available
2021-06-03 15:26:37	daegalus	im never truely anti anything, i just have a strong opinion and try to avoid, but dont eliminate.
2021-06-03 15:26:44	manicennui	I need to find a good overview of X, Wayland, compositors, window managers, login managers, desktop environments, and how they all fit together.

2021-06-03 15:27:10	daegalus	Good luck with that rabbit hole. Its probably why linux desktop is such a mess
2021-06-03 15:27:12	niflce	manicennui that's annoying me also
2021-06-03 15:27:50	manicennui	daegalus: Yeah, that and the fact that the 15 pieces you will likely use to build a suitable environment are all configured separately and using wildly different methods.
2021-06-03 15:28:51	niflce	 to remember even more commands
2021-06-03 15:29:11	daegalus	between linux desktop messiness, nvidia being antagonistic to linux env, Intel being friendlier but lots of bugs, AMD great, but so few laptops come with AMD gpus. then there is the whole X vs Wayland battle royale. and  so on. im for Wayland, so im glad its finally getting stable, but man is it still a mess. Its hard to be a linux desktop user and not go insane after a while with all the bugs
2021-06-03 15:29:14	daegalus	and broken things
2021-06-03 15:29:37	daegalus	Gaming on linux is fairly good nowadays though, so as a gamer, thats no longer a blocker.
2021-06-03 15:30:03	manicennui	I mean, most things just work for me if I use something like Ubuntu, but Ubuntu feels sluggish.
2021-06-03 15:30:17	manicennui	I really want to use a simple tiling window manager.
2021-06-03 15:30:28	niflce	and bloated
2021-06-03 15:30:33	manicennui	But then I still have to know how to configure gtk apps, etc.

2021-06-03 15:32:02	companion_cube	pe: still disagree, rust is slow to build but at least it's clean
2021-06-03 15:32:08	companion_cube	(cargo works pretty well)
2021-06-03 15:32:31	pe	Cargo is one of the things I dislike about Rust the most.

2021-06-03 15:33:18	niflce	maybe ur right for Im not good at it ,
2021-06-03 15:33:24	daegalus	Im fairly happy with Manjaro. has the user friendliness of Ubuntu, but the packages and aur of Arch. Its a great middle ground for power users.
2021-06-03 15:33:46	daegalus	I hear EndeavorOS is good too
2021-06-03 15:34:02	drobilla	I'm running Manjaro on my workstation sort of coincidentally and it's been pretty alright
2021-06-03 15:34:09	hoistbypetard	daegalus: hot take: i love manjaro, but i think if you're going to use aur you should use arch.
2021-06-03 15:34:11	wrl	pe: what's the problem with cargo?
2021-06-03 15:34:39	drobilla	As a long time boring Debian stable user, though, being afraid of updating is pretty annoying
2021-06-03 15:35:11	drobilla	and as a dev, some things like not shipping multiple toolchain versions is suuuper annoying
2021-06-03 15:35:24	pe	wrl: ridiculously complex, verbose and annoying, compared to Go.
2021-06-03 15:35:27	hoistbypetard	companion_cube: i'm with you. the ease of building things in rust is fine IMO. it's certainly easier than cmake or autotools or even conan. it may not be faster, but it's not harder

2021-06-03 15:49:32	drobilla	Speaking of Manjaro, I don't suppose anyone has any experience of how well an update after 6 months or so is likely to go?

2021-06-03 15:53:43	kline	drobilla, the padding was anti-static and not fluffy? (so as to avoid catching on and leaving bits behind)
2021-06-03 15:53:55	Brekkjern	jazz: Everything that you don't personally use is bloat.

2021-06-03 15:54:49	jazz	being able to pull from git repos easily is handy, i've done it a few times for dealing with forks
2021-06-03 15:55:06	kline	drobilla, im 99% sure its fine but its not best practice

2021-06-03 15:55:56	pe	jazz: and Go is the best toolchain I've worked with.
2021-06-03 15:56:18	jazz	i haven't worked with >1.16 but <1.16, dealing with forks was a huge PITA
2021-06-03 15:56:42	drobilla	kline: Yeah, I mean, it's a slightly sketchy custom watercooled thing, so there's an awful lot of very-not-best practice going on here :)  Assembled I could keep the loop sealed, which avoids a whole other world of nightmare

2021-06-03 16:16:17	manicennui	I feel like a lot of people want to write C and Go *because* they want to reinvent some of those things, since they either don't exist in the standard library or there is no clear defacto standard for which library to use.
2021-06-03 16:16:26	daegalus	i really need to move this enter key somewhere else, i keep misclicking it
2021-06-03 16:16:47	hoistbypetard	daegalus: a package you didn't touch, or a package you touched at a different moment than i did :). they move fast. my point was more that i'd rather know the details i know after an arch install if i need to troubleshoot aur errors, and i don't know those for a manjaro install. but when aur works it's awesome on manjaro too.

2021-06-04 13:51:07	companion_cube	I honestly am pretty happy with how -safe-string worked out for OCaml
2021-06-04 13:51:14	technomancy	honestly the reason it was so shocking is that the rest of ocaml (modulo OOP) seemed so sensible that I never even considered the possibility that strings would be mutable until someone pointed it out to me
2021-06-04 13:51:14	companion_cube	the transition was reasonably smooth
2021-06-04 13:51:17	manicennui	I now think that OO is one of the worst things to happen to software development.

2021-06-04 13:51:47	technomancy	companion_cube: maybe the transition was smooth because other people like me didn't even consider the possibility that strings were mutable? =D

2021-06-04 13:54:00	companion_cube	(it's called "bytes" in modern OCaml)
2021-06-04 13:54:02	manicennui	I think at a minimum, languages should make you explicitly indicate that you want things to be mutable.
2021-06-04 13:54:03	ngoldbaum	couldn’t a string literal be const or something? (i don’t know ML)

2021-06-09 15:20:02	meff[m]	manicennui: exactly, it keeps making me wonder. You can also of course do everything with integers (or "rationals" represented by a pair of ints), but then you're running into integer smoothness issues
2021-06-09 15:20:21	manicennui	meff[m]: Ruby has BigDecimal, and PostgreSQL has a decimal type.
2021-06-09 15:20:31	meff[m]	I should look into how those types work
2021-06-09 15:20:37	manicennui	Our database is actually correct in nearly all cases.
2021-06-09 15:20:45	meff[m]	It's a problem that's been on my mind for years. Finance is one aspect, and graphics is another.
2021-06-09 15:20:57	meff[m]	I don't doubt that people smarter than me know how this all works
2021-06-09 15:21:01	manicennui	BigDecimal is an arbitrary precision library.
2021-06-09 15:21:15	meff[m]	so is a BigDecimal then a good approximation for a real number?
2021-06-09 15:21:16	manicennui	I believe most arbitrary precision libraries use ints.
2021-06-09 15:21:30	imode	big decimal sounds like a lobbying group for more accuracy in calculators.

2021-06-09 15:23:46	meff[m]	idk if that even matters in a db though
2021-06-09 15:24:09	imode	it kinda does, kinda doesn't. if you're looking to use them for fast math, they're decent but not that decent.
2021-06-09 15:24:31	imode	the operations have the complexity > O(1) for larger integers.

2021-06-09 15:24:55	meff[m]	gotcha

2021-06-09 15:30:23	meff[m]	right, probably matters a decent amount in tight loops though
2021-06-09 15:31:02	manicennui	We generally use small decimals in postgres (you actually set the size).
2021-06-09 15:31:12	manicennui	And we don't really do any processing with them directly in the database.
2021-06-09 15:31:57	companion_cube	you can do fun stuff where you use pointer tagging
2021-06-09 15:32:03	companion_cube	so that small integers are still themselves
2021-06-09 15:32:07	manicennui	We actually have one implementation of amortization written in Ruby, and it probably has a big impact there.
2021-06-09 15:32:11	companion_cube	(with one fewer bit)
2021-06-09 15:32:16	meff[m]	ah, so you alias directly into the integer when possible?
2021-06-09 15:32:41	companion_cube	if LSB is 1, it's an integer
2021-06-09 15:32:43	companion_cube	just >>1
2021-06-09 15:32:52	companion_cube	otherwise it's a pointer to a heap allcoated bigint
2021-06-09 15:32:58	companion_cube	that works on platforms where pointers are aligned
2021-06-09 15:33:35	manicennui	I forget the name for the naive amortization technique. It is pretty CPU intense.

2021-06-09 15:41:30	manicennui	There was also a version written in C that we didn't use because there is something about the schedules it produces that business doesn't like.

2021-06-09 15:46:18	manicennui	In some part of the Ruby implementation of our amortization code.
2021-06-09 15:46:29	pretty_dumm_guy	interesting.
2021-06-09 15:46:49	manicennui	I think our schedules are quite a bit more complicated than mortgages.
2021-06-09 15:47:00	manicennui	They aren't one payment per month for N months.
2021-06-09 15:47:15	manicennui	There are a ton of rules around them, plus business requirements to increase repayment.
2021-06-09 15:48:16	pretty_dumm_guy	this definitely sounds interesting

2021-06-09 15:49:23	meff[m]	If it's older code it's also understandable, but these days I'd probably just use some BLAS type library in whatever language I was using
2021-06-09 15:49:38	pretty_dumm_guy	however, I am just wondering why floating point issues are a problem. More often than not, you use maximum of three decimal places when dealing with money
2021-06-09 15:50:11	pretty_dumm_guy	meff[m]: yeah most modern languages have some form of wrapper around mature BLAS libraries

2021-06-09 16:37:39	iDrougge	skyl4rk: Because then, 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3
2021-06-09 16:37:51	skyl4rk	I mean, sure familiarity for the general human is better with base 10 than base 2
2021-06-09 16:38:05	iDrougge	That in itself should be reason enough. :)
2021-06-09 16:38:16	iDrougge	That's the general consumption thing.
2021-06-09 16:39:09	manicennui	iDrougge is racist against computers and their different math culture.
2021-06-09 16:39:12	skyl4rk	but general consumption is also about wide-spread use, and efficient resource usage (need for power = need for cooling) and cost of implementation plays a part then as well
2021-06-09 16:40:17	skyl4rk	and base ten has the same kind of problems, it's just that we are so accustomed to them that we ignore them, 10/3 = 3.33333....
2021-06-09 16:40:25	iDrougge	I'm not saying scientists modelling weather systems should use the same numeric type. They should probably use a floating point type of some sorts.
2021-06-09 16:41:24	iDrougge	It's not that we are so accustomed that we ignore them; we know those problems and therefore don't ignore them. Earlier today, manicennui mentioned how his colleagues, who work as programmers, were unaware of the limitations of floating point.

2021-06-09 16:47:03	skyl4rk	I guess "being a programmer" has not been *one* thing for quite a while now, and the paths have diverged for so long that the required knowledge have grown to be quite different
2021-06-09 16:47:26	manicennui	Eh.
2021-06-09 16:47:53	manicennui	The profession mostly reinvents the same shit repeatedly.
2021-06-09 16:47:57	skyl4rk	yes
2021-06-09 16:48:01	skyl4rk	but in different ways
2021-06-09 16:48:17	iDrougge	If it even reinvents; often it just copies.
2021-06-09 16:48:22	manicennui	But we aren't even talking about knowing the specifics, just the high level concepts.
2021-06-09 16:48:34	manicennui	I couldn't tell you exactly how floats are encoded in memory.
2021-06-09 16:49:59	manicennui	I know it involves a fancy Latin word.
2021-06-09 16:50:03	iDrougge	My little brother recently took an introductory course in C#. The drill questions tried to teach the students the point of different types, several times asking about use cases for floats, where the use case was "a number with decimals".
2021-06-09 16:51:20	iDrougge	That is quite common in introductions to programming. Students are taught the two basic numeric types: int and float. Not the three basic types.

2021-06-09 16:51:52	manicennui	Not all languages have a decimal type.

2021-06-09 16:52:24	iDrougge	Not all languages have an integer type.
2021-06-09 16:52:25	skyl4rk	that was the third?
2021-06-09 16:52:27	technomancy	C has one type: number
2021-06-09 16:52:32	manicennui	int, float, and void pointer?
2021-06-09 16:52:33	technomancy	some numbers are numbers about other numbers
2021-06-09 16:52:42	skyl4rk	rational would be another contender for the third

2021-06-09 17:01:41	iDrougge	And because Go doesn't support operator overloading (except on its own privileged types), it's not something you can just import.

2021-06-10 10:04:45	Brekkjern	SD Cards aren't really meant to be long term storage. They fail somewhat unpredictably. Especially if they are written to a lot.
2021-06-10 10:05:08	Brekkjern	So depending on the reliability you are after it might not be your best bet.
2021-06-10 10:05:30	Brekkjern	Something like an Intel NUC tends to live longer and also has more power if you need that.

2021-06-10 10:13:39	_0x5fc3	Anybody know of hosting providers that are cheaper than Hetzner’s Finland datacenters? None of their competitors seem to catch up with them in regards to price.

2021-06-10 10:43:10	manicennui	Are you using their dedicated servers? OMG what about cloud?!
2021-06-10 10:43:29	indigo	Bare metal or bust
2021-06-10 10:44:46	_0x5fc3	I use bare metal, but their cloud was cheaper than DO the last time I checked. Never used though.
2021-06-10 10:44:47	manicennui	It's been so long since I've looked into dedicated servers. I don't even know who the good providers are in the US.
2021-06-10 10:45:27	manicennui	I honestly thought that Rackspace was really well positioned at one point, but they seem to have fucked things up.
2021-06-10 10:46:03	_0x5fc3	Linode bare metal is coming too, i think
2021-06-10 10:46:13	manicennui	Rackspace became public in 2008, and in 2016 was purchased and taken private by Apollo Global Management LLC.[6]
2021-06-10 10:46:13	manicennui	In June 2020 it changed its name to Rackspace Technology. Then in August 2020, Rackspace Technology went public again under the symbol RXT on the NASDAQ market.
2021-06-10 10:46:24	manicennui	Okay then.
2021-06-10 10:46:28	manicennui	_0x5fc3: Interesting.
2021-06-10 10:46:36	manicennui	I use them for some personal VPS.
2021-06-10 10:46:37	indigo	IIRC Rackspace manages your AWS resources now

2021-06-10 10:49:25	manicennui	We actually have a large cage in two different datacenters at work, but I know better than to get involved in that line of work again.
2021-06-10 10:49:45	manicennui	We went on a tour of one of them once.

2021-06-10 10:50:18	manicennui	I've also worked as a sys admin at two different companies that had cages.
2021-06-10 10:50:47	_0x5fc3	Lomanic[m], OVH and scaleway, yes, but they're at least 1.5x pricier than Hetzner

2021-06-10 10:56:01	JordiGH	c355e3b: Hey, a while ago you mentioned tagging things in S3 for deletion. But I still don't get how that works. If you tag them and then have a deletion policy for deleting things, will the deletion countdown timer start from the moment of tagging or from the moment the S3 file was created?
2021-06-10 10:57:12	@c355e3b	Moment the tag happens
2021-06-10 10:58:15	@c355e3b	The polices can either be key prefix based or tag based
2021-06-10 10:58:39	@c355e3b	When it’s either moved or tagged the clock starts
2021-06-10 10:58:58	indigo	manicennui: Would the racks be outside?
2021-06-10 10:58:59	@c355e3b	NB: this uses a special delete mechanism that can bypass any rate limiting which is nice
2021-06-10 10:59:20	manicennui	indigo: Maybe the datacenter would have areas with windows and nice views.

2021-06-10 11:01:11	manicennui	Ah.
2021-06-10 11:02:04	manicennui	There should be a large nature preserve within 5-10 miles of everyone.
2021-06-10 11:03:45	JordiGH	Hm, okay, I didn't find the right policy to make it tag-based.
2021-06-10 11:04:58	indigo	I think the closest national park to me is the Santa Monica Mountains
2021-06-10 11:07:14	manicennui	The problem with such things here is that they become packed whenever the weather is halfway decent.
2021-06-10 11:07:41	manicennui	Starved Rock (state park) is amazing, but not very large and always packed with people when the weather is nice.
2021-06-10 11:08:05	manicennui	When I went to North Carolina, I really liked how many state parks there were, and how few people were in each of them.
2021-06-10 11:08:15	manicennui	There is a really nice park outside of Durham even.
2021-06-10 11:08:31	manicennui	No mountains or anything, but some decent elevation changes, and a stream, etc.

2021-06-10 12:01:21	manicennui	The park was Eno River State Park. You should do a bit of research before going because there are a bunch of different trails and places to park.
2021-06-10 12:01:31	manicennui	I think there is a park near Raleigh with waterfalls though.

2021-06-10 13:53:35	bradfier	Honestly I think the most likely outcome here is droves of people do follow through and quit, Amazon and Goog replace with with grads at even more obscene starting salaries, and the quality of their products continues to plummet

2021-06-10 13:54:48	imode	our regression test data, that we, y'know, use to ensure that things aren't broken when they go out the door, is now a month out of date.

2021-06-23 11:23:48	manicennui	I'm not a big believer in supplements, but from time to time I'll try one because why not? A couple months ago I decided to try a probiotic. I had tried a couple in the past, but I didn't notice any changes, or at least nothing significant.
2021-06-23 11:24:05	manicennui	But this one seems to have a huge positive impact on my digestion.

2021-06-23 11:25:27	dasm	now there is no more this issue though. you can solve a math, schedule for later and send in the middle of night ;)

More of just one of many factors in weight. The number 1 thing for seeing teh number go down on the scale is caloric intake. Even if you dont count categories, eating reasonable portions, maximizing protein, and eliminating
2021-06-23 14:11:13	daegalus	added sugars, usually does the most for weight loss. But everyone is different so different things work for different people, calories is just the only thing that is directly related to the number on the scale (this is information from multiple nutritionists and metabolic experts I have gone to for weight loss help. Lost 35 lbs in the last 3 months)

I was quoted a minimum of 100g per day is my requirement just to supply my body with the necessary things to function. 130g ideally. Thats 40+ grams per meal. Thats 8 oz of chicken, or fish, tofu, etc per meal. or equivalent. You just need a lot per meal to hit those kind of numbers. I used to average 60-80. protein just makes

2021-06-23 17:04:31	alb	ghurabah: your VPS provider can, with varying degrees of effort (depending on implementation), always access your disk while your VPS is active. So encrypting makes it both more difficult, and "impossible" to do it while your VPS is not running

2021-06-23 17:08:11	ghurabah	hassle to what extent?
2021-06-23 17:08:18	alb	ghurabah: yeah, if you don't want any random intern to access your data, either you use a provider you trust a lot to get this right (there wouldn't be many I do), and/or it's probably worth doing
2021-06-23 17:09:15	ghurabah	hmm
2021-06-23 17:09:16	alb	ghurabah: in my case, because it requires re-partitioning, and I store the key remotely and use a hook to unlock the disk on boot

2021-06-23 17:09:48	badtuple	not technical as much as political, but depending on your situation then being able to throw around the term "encrypted at rest" is like magic for certain lawyers, auditors, and credentialers.
2021-06-23 17:11:14	alb	ghurabah: I use a thing I wrote (https://blitiri.com.ar/p/kxd/) for doing that. There are other projects that do similar things. I don't know of a better way, tbh, because the alternative is either store the key on another disk (kinda defeats the purpose of encrypting it in the first place), or I have to manually ssh in and unlock it (which I don't want to rely on :)

2021-06-23 17:13:26	alb	ghurabah: what you're doing in your VPS might be subject to regulatory compliance that requires the data to be encrypted at rest, OR you could have clients that require it, OR insurance that gets cheaper if you do it, etc.
2021-06-23 17:13:39	ghurabah	I see now
2021-06-23 17:14:26	badtuple	^ what alb said. And the people checking your compliance don't necessarily understand the things they are checking, as insane as that sounds. But "encrypted at rest" is a phrase they've heard before and it's useful.

2021-06-24 10:46:49	iDrougge	OTOH, that's where you make a difference.
2021-06-24 10:47:14	iDrougge	johnhowell: Well, with SDL2, you have all the amenities of the early 80s at your disposal.
2021-06-24 10:47:23	iDrougge	It's not really "GUI".

2021-06-24 10:47:59	johnhowell	iDrougge: the other gui was written in Java Swing I believe was the name. I chose SDL2 cause I thought "Brushing up on my c++ would be nice" lol
2021-06-24 10:49:13	iDrougge	I learned Java from a book where they had amended it with a few Swing chapters, but I never came that far.
2021-06-24 10:49:52	johnhowell	I just looked at the repo, it was Swing. Also a lot more spelling errors in this repo than I remember. Also crazy this code is almost a decade old
2021-06-24 10:50:52	iDrougge	Wasn't Swing old even then?

2021-06-24 10:56:46	besnn	does GitLab have any benefits over GitHub?
2021-06-24 10:57:15	@c355e3b	its not github
2021-06-24 10:57:21	@c355e3b	and people claim the on-prem is better
2021-06-24 10:57:22	johnhowell	I am not sure, I just switched when I found out MS acquired GitHub and I don't really like MS
2021-06-24 10:57:41	johnhowell	Microsoft that is, not the user named MS in here apparently lol
2021-06-24 10:59:23	besnn	there was someone asking about ls on a linux channel and there was a user called ls
2021-06-24 10:59:34	technomancy	I started using gitlab when github introduced their terrible textarea key bindings
2021-06-24 10:59:52	technomancy	so the whole "doesn't steal keystrokes" was a big win
2021-06-24 11:00:07	technomancy	but nowadays gitlab is so slow as to be nearly unusable
2021-06-24 11:00:09	badtuple	If my name was ls I'd just respond with the default home folders in a popular distro.
2021-06-24 11:02:01	johnhowell	I mirrored my gitlab to my own personal git server, I just haven't setup a frontend for it yet. Been thinking of getting Gitea running

2021-06-24 11:03:27	reno	I haven't used it extensively, but sourcehut has been pretty nice, as another alternative to check out (and can also be self hosted IIRC)
2021-06-24 11:03:44	technomancy	sourcehut is also a lot better, but it's more work to run your own
